# Ecommerce-Customers
This project is to predicts the amount that is spent by a customer annually based on the data that is available on the store or ecommerce


This project has been forked from "Benjamin Jones'Linear Regression Project" in kaggle

In this I am going to analyse all the attributes and their correlation and statistical fluke,etc

This project needs a complete understanding of linear regression mathematically and some statistics like standard deviation,variance,and distributions.
